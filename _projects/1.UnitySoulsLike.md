### Description:
This game is a mimic of the Dark Souls series. I have implemented basic Dark Souls features such as dodge roll, camera lock-on, player attack, and boss patterns.

### What I worked on:
- Implemented 3D movement including slope movment and dodge roll using FSM and Rigidbody in Unity                                                    
- Developed a combo attack system through FSM, enhancing gameplay interactivity
- Constructed a target lock-on camera system with FSM, ensuring focused gameplay experience
- Built basic enemy and boss using FSM, enhancing game feel
- Handled camera jittering issues, ensuring smooth visual transitions
